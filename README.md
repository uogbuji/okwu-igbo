South Central Igbo is the focus, but other variants are given where possible. Please note that no politics is intended by this focus. It is purely the self-interest of the project's founder, who is from Umunakanu, in Mbano. Mbano has a rather unique dialect, so there will be a lot of coverage of Owerri Igbo.


# To do

"Addressing people" and later in https://wikitravel.org/en/Igbo_phrasebook
