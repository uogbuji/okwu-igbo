## Chí

n.

Spirit entity intimately connected with an individual person and with their traits and fortunes, really a person's spirit self. Often connected to Western notions of soul and even guardian angels, but such comparisons can be limiting.

* note: parallel Yoruba concept of Ikeji, which is the double of a person's Ori, literally "head", as metonym for their corporeal person.
* Acc to Ejizu, 1992, Chí is often symbolically connected to a twig from the ọ̀há tree (same whose leaves are used for soup), or the Ogbu/Ogilisi (Newbouldia laevis), or Ububa; also with ìtè (clay pot) or ọ̀kụ̀/ọ̀kwà (clay or wooden food prep bowl). "The shrine of Chí is usually a clay mound 2-4 feet high on top of which an [ọ̀kụ̀] is set, or at times pieces of stone are stuck..." This altar is called ọ̀kụ̀ Chí" In the mid-western, north-west & south-central Igbo regions the ọ̀kụ̀ usually holds 4 twigs each 4-6 inches. Prominently placed in the case of men, but often hidden away in the case of women, either in the rafters or by their bed heads.
* Acc to Ejizu, 1992, the establishment of one's Chí shrine is an important part of the rites of entering adulthood, representing the personal responsibility that has emerged. Idọ Chí [not in Echeruo] for men and Ihọta Chí [not in Echeruo] for women.
* Acc to Ejizu, 1992, the ritual feast month for Chí is ọnwa ilọ mmuo or ọnwa ilọ Chí.

Day; dawn; daylight

* 
* cite: "day or daylight but it most commonly used for those transitional periods between day and night or night and day. Thus we speak of chi ofufo meaning daybreak and chi ojiji, nightfall. We also have the word mgbachi for that most potent hour of noon that splits the day in two, a time favoured in folklore by itinerant spirits and feared by children."
