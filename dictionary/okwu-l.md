1. great egret [Ardea alba]

* tag: ńnụ̀nụ
* note: subject of a popular children's song/game. If anyone spots the bird he sings: "Chekeleke nyem mbo ocha ka iwere oji" ("Find an egret, give me a white finger so you can have my black finger.") while they shake hands. The idea is that the egret is supposed to give its color to whom asks for it, so the players presumably wish to have the novelty of bleached fingers.
