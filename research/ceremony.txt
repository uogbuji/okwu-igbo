Mbomuzo: Festival of community road maintenance (related to Iriji?)

"Igbo people usually say Ndụ bụ Isi (Life first)…the overall conceptualization of the kolanut among the Igbo is that it is a life affirming principle. The [kolanut] ritual invocation will include Chukwu, ancestors, the clan deities, the spirit forces, especially the market days. Finally…an affirmation of life:"

"Ndi ebe anyị
anyị ga adị
anyị goro ka anyị dịrị
ọ bụghị ka anyị nwụọ

["Our people
we shall live
we have prayed for life
not for death]

…

Onye wetara ọji wetara ndụ [He who brings kola brings life]

…

"Supreme Being used to be very close to human beings but later withdrew to the sky because a woman used to poke her pestle in the sky while pounding her foofoo late in the night."

"This incessant disturbance [caused] God to withdraw. [This] probably gave rise to the concept of deus otiosus—the withdrawn God, a concept that God does not enmesh himself in human affairs. It has also been suggested that it could be that it is this withdrawal of God that gave rise to the Igbo expressions:"

Mmadụ bụ chukwu a na afụ anya n'ụwa   [A human being is the god that is seen in the world]

Madụ bụ chi ibe ya    [A human being is a god to another person]

…

"The Igbo hardly ever resign [themselves] to fate, they hardly give up in a struggle which they set their minds on. This is supported by [the] sayings:"

Otụ egwu mgbagbu adịghị eje ọgụ   [If you are afraid of death you won't go to war]

di ochi anagị akwụsị ịrị enu akwụ maka na ọ dara n'enu ya   [A palm wine tapper does not stop tapping because he fell from a palm wine tree]

ebe ọkụ nyụrụ achịsa ọwa    [Surrender comes only after one had tried all one could]

…

Eziokwu dika ehihie (efifie)    [Truth is like noonday]

Anaghị eli eziokwu n'ala    [Truth cannot be buried in the ground]

Eziokwu na'elu ilu    [Truth is bitter]

…

Ọfọ ka ide ji awa ala   [Truth and justice are the content of life]

Oji ọfọ anaghị atọ n'ije    [The man of truth is never stranded in a journey]

Ezi okwu bụ ndụ   [Truth is life]

…

egbuwa ọfịa a hụ akụ    [When you clear the forest you see wealth]

…

[Traditional saying, pre-christian:]

I makwa na Chukwu no    [Don't you know there is God?/that God abides?]
